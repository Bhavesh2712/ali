But while even the best breathing technique would probably not make much of a difference to our writing, any improvement in the way we organise the everyday writing, how we take notes of what we encounter and what we do with them, will make all the difference for the moment we do face the blank page/screen – or rather not, as those who take smart notes will never have the problem of a blank screen again.”</li></ul><ul id="47e3e3c9-2462-4128-9681-118b82a2fcec" class="bulleted-list"><li> </li></ul><ul id="a0583547-f207-42e8-ad89-99df5e1b7881" class="bulleted-list"><li>When we’re confronted with a blank page, it’s easy to think “I can’t write when I’m staring at a blank page” and then Google solutions for blank page syndrome.

In fact, there is no measurable correlation between a high IQ and academic success – at least not north of 120. Yes, a certain intellectual capacity helps to get into academia, and if you struggle severely with an IQ test, it is likely that you will struggle to solve academic problems, too. But once you are in, a superior IQ will neither help you to distinguish yourself nor protect you from failure. What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004). </li></ul><ul id="9bc849b8-7e5e-4340-a521-61aaaf24dd12" class="bulleted-list"><li> </li></ul><ul id="c7da070e-2feb-4475-9a23-c75a90a539bf" class="bulleted-list"><li>People struggle with writing (and creating generally) because it&#x27;s too much of a heavy lift.

Sure, planning will get you through your exams if you stick to them and push through. But it will not make you an expert in the art of learning/writing/note-taking (there is research on that: cf. Chapter 1.3). Planners are also unlikely to continue with their studies after they finish their examinations. They are rather glad it is over. Experts, on the other hand, would not even consider voluntarily giving up what has already proved to be rewarding and fun: learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas.

The principle of GTD is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we actually do everything we once intended to do, but it forces us to make clear choices and regularly check if our tasks still fit into the bigger picture. Only if we know that everything is taken care of, from the important to the trivial, can we let go and focus on what is right in front of us. Only if nothing else is lingering in our working memory and taking up valuable mental resources can we experience what Allen calls a “mind like water” - the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts. The principle is simple but holistic. It is not a quick fix or a fancy tool. It doesn’t do the work for you. But it does provide a structure for our everyday work that deals with the fact that most distractions do not come so much from our environment, but our own minds.”</li></ul><ul id="6b4bf5d0-17ab-4fb7-81ec-bd8963875189" class="bulleted-list"><li>But GTD doesn’t help with writing because it’s not linear. The ‘next steps’ are things like ‘look up this footnote’ or ‘write a paragraph’ or ‘reread a chapter’. Most of these are too small to be worth writing down, and it’s hard to anticipate what the next one should be. But if we zoom too far out, we get ‘write a page’ which is equally pointless.</li></ul><ul id="508d5bac-5f44-47b5-ba40-5e0bc8c0a661" class="bulleted-list"><li>The key is a holistic perspective.

Schmidt concluded his productivity could only be explained by his unique working technique (Schmidt 2013, 168). That technique has never been a secret – Luhmann was always open about it. He regularly mentioned the slip-box as the reason for his productivity. From as early as 1985, his standard answer to the question of how anyone could be so productive was: “I, of course, do not think everything by myself. It happens mainly within the slip-box” (Luhmann, Baecker, and Stanitzek 1987, 142). But few gave the slip-box and the way he worked with it a closer look, dismissing his explanation as the modest understatement of a genius.”</li></ul><ul id="a753ef72-74f7-4acd-8ce1-3f7c406c31fe" class="bulleted-list"><li>“ His productivity is, of course, impressive.

He not only stressed that he never forced himself to do something he didn’t feel like, he even said: “I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 154f.)[4]”</li></ul><ul id="0a2879b2-1277-4a7e-a1e9-c73dc126ad0e" class="bulleted-list"><li>“ Until recently, almost no one really seemed to believe it. We are still so used to the idea that a great outcome requires great effort that we tend not to believe that a simple change in our work routines could not only make us more productive, but the work also more fun. But doesn’t it make much more sense that the impressive body of work was produced not in spite of the fact he never made himself do anything he didn’t feel like, but because of it? Even hard work can be fun as long as it is aligned with our intrinsic goals and we feel in control. The problems arise when we set up our work in such an inflexible way that we can’t adjust it when things change and become arrested in a process that seems to develop a life of its own.”</li></ul></li></ul><ul id="ed88acf7-3a85-4f36-9d36-dae06eec8bba" class="bulleted-list"><li>“ Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place (cf.

If they have an idea, they write it into their notebook, and if an article seems important enough, they make the effort and write an excerpt. Working like this will leave you with a lot of different notes in many different places. Writing, then, means to rely heavily on your brain to remember where and when these notes were written down. A text must then be conceptualised independently from these notes, which explains why so many resort to brainstorming to arrange the resources afterwards according to this preconceived idea.

The video labs stuff I guess is useful to help me think about target audience, brand etc? Do those tie in with the sorts of stuff I want permanent notes on? Or can they just be chucked in Notion. Notion for project notes (but Evernote for quick storing content about projects). Drafts for fleeting notes.

A friend of mine does not let any idea, interesting finding or quote he stumbles upon dwindle away and writes everything down. He always carries a notebook with him and often makes a few quick notes during a conversation. The advantage is obvious: No idea ever gets lost. The disadvantages are serious, though: As he treats every note as if it belongs to the “permanent” category, the notes will never build up a critical mass. The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight. On top of that, the strict chronological order does not offer any help to find, combine or rearrange ideas in a productive sense. It is not surprising that my friend has a bookshelf filled with notebooks full of wonderful ideas, but not a single publication to show.”</li></ul><ul id="4a21bab1-15b1-4d3a-9724-9eca803bc821" class="bulleted-list"><li><strong>“The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form.

In the first case, you constantly need to add energy to keep the process going. In the second case, the reaction, once triggered, continues by itself and even releases energy. The dynamics of work are not so different. Sometimes we feel like our work is draining our energy and we can only move forward if we put more and more energy into it. But sometimes it is the opposite. Once we get into the workflow, it is as if the work itself gains momentum, pulling us along and sometimes even energizing us. This is the kind of dynamic we are looking for.” #studying #motivation #productivity</li></ul><ul id="1a781847-1ec4-411b-86e0-d0290c38ad9d" class="bulleted-list"><li>“A good workflow can easily turn into a virtuous circle, where the positive experience motivates us to take on the next task with ease, which helps us to get better at what we are doing, which in return makes it more likely for us to enjoy the work, and so on.
